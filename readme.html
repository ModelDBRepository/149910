This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

 Gutierrez GJ, O'Leary T, Marder E (2013) Multiple mechanisms switch
 an electrically coupled, synaptically inhibited neuron between
 competing rhythmic oscillators. Neuron 77:845-58

This matlab model code was contributed by Dr G. Gutierrez.

Instructions: First run gsynA_gel_circuit_sim_ode45.m (on a 2013
MacBook Pro laptop it took 2 hours 23 minutes), then
ParameterscapeFreqPlot.m which should produce a figure like the paper
